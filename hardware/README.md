# Hardware Overview: Noise-as-Information Sensor

This folder contains all designs, parts, and schematics to build the multi-scale sensor system.

##  Design Philosophy

Traditional sensors filter noise.  
**Ours are built to embrace it.**

This hardware setup captures unfiltered chaos across quantum, biological, electromagnetic, and planetary scales — allowing the system to detect coherence, field effects, and environmental intelligence.

##  Core Components by Layer

### 1. Quantum Layer

- High-speed clock (ps or GHz scale)
- Entropy-based RNG (Quantum signature detection)
- Ultra-fast ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
- Shielded circuit for noise preservation

### 2. Biological Layer

- VOC sensor (e.g. MQ-135)
- CO₂ / CH₄ / O₃ gas sensors
- Temperature + humidity
- Soil or air microbial sensors (optional)

### 3. Electromagnetic Layer

- DIY magnetometer (HMC5883L or QMC5883L)
- Geiger counter (cosmic rays, radiation)
- Schumann resonance pickup (7.83 Hz antenna)
- EMF detector (wide-band RF sweep)

### 4. Planetary Layer

- Barometric pressure + wind sensor
- GPS for geolocation tagging
- Satellite input (weather/solar APIs)
- Seismic or vibration sensor (geophones)

##  Power & Control

- Arduino Mega / ESP32
- Optional Raspberry Pi for dashboard
- Solar-powered battery module for off-grid use

---

##  Prototype Tips

- Keep sensors exposed, not shielded
- Log **all** data — do not pre-filter
- Sample at multiple rates per sensor (slow + burst)
- Time-sync multiple sensors using master clock

##  Coming Soon

- Breadboard wiring diagrams
- Modular PCB layouts
- Sensor fusion board (for high-efficiency capture)
