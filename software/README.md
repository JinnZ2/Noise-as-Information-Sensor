# Software Architecture: Noise-as-Information Processing

This folder contains Python modules for decoding chaos into multi-layered intelligence across:

- Quantum Field
- Biological Network Chatter
- Electromagnetic Disruption
- Planetary Climate Feedback

Each module extracts information from what is typically discarded as "noise."

##  Software Layers

### `quantum_processor.py`
- Extracts quantum coherence from sensor jitter
- Detects entanglement signatures via correlation spikes
- Flags zero-point fluctuations

### `bio_processor.py`
- Analyzes VOC and chemical irregularities
- Matches against known plant/animal stress signals
- Detects interspecies communication patterns

### `em_field_processor.py`
- Aligns molecular disturbances with solar and EM activity
- Detects Schumann resonance shifts
- Flags geomagnetic and cosmic ray disruptions

### `gaia_processor.py`
- Captures climate-level noise
- Runs multi-scale chaos pattern matching
- Detects planetary system coordination and instability

---

##  `dashboard.py`

- Real-time visualizations
- Shows all noise scores (quantum, biological, EM, planetary)
- Predicts system stress and behavior triggers

---

##  `noise_engine.py`

- Central fusion engine combining all processors
- Calculates total system coherence and information density
- Enables environmental prediction and cross-scale learning

---

##  Notes

- Raw data is always preserved
- All signal processing is **non-filtering**
- Patterns are extracted via symbolic and machine learning methods
